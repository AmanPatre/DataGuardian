# ðŸš€ Minimal Fix for DataGuardian

## The Real Problem

The extension has communication issues between content script and background script. Let's fix this step by step.

## Step 1: Test with Simple Page

1. Open `frontend/simple-test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test Tracker Blocking"
3. Click "Check Settings"

## Step 2: If Still Not Working

The issue might be that the extension isn't properly built or loaded. Try this:

### Option A: Rebuild Extension

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Then reload the extension in Chrome.

### Option B: Check Extension Loading

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Make sure DataGuardian is enabled
3. Click "Reload" on the extension
4. Check for any error messages

### Option C: Manual Test

1. Open any website (like google.com)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Type: `window.dataGuardianContent`
5. If it returns `undefined`, the content script isn't loading

## Step 3: Quick Debug

If nothing works, tell me:

1. What do you see in `chrome://extensions/` for DataGuardian?
2. What happens when you click the DataGuardian icon in your browser toolbar?
3. Do you see any errors in the extension's background page?

## The Core Issue

The extension needs to be properly loaded and the background script needs to be running. Once that's working, the communication will work.

Let me know what you see with the simple test page!
